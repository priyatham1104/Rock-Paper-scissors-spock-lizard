# Rock-Paper-scissors-spock-lizard

A simple and fun game from the big bang theory.

1) get_images: A code that uses opencv to extract images from your webcam. stores thwm in the respective directories with just a few clicks.
2) Converting images to data points: A code to convert the images to arrays and store them as pickle files.
3) Model Training: Build a simple convolutional neural network and train it on the data.
4) Designing the game: Use open cv for real time prediciton. we get a random move from the computer and the code recognizes our move. The winner is then based on the below algorithm.

                    Scissors cuts Paper

                    Paper covers Rock

                    Rock crushes Lizard

                    Lizard poisons Spock

                    Spock smashes Scissors

                    Scissors decapitates Lizard

                    Lizard eats Paper

                    Paper disproves Spock

                    Spock vaporizes Rock

                    (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors

Note: A simple convnet. used only for demonstrative purposes.
