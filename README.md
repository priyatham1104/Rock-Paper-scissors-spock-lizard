A simple and fun game from the big bang theory.

1) get_images: A code that uses opencv to extract images from your webcam. stores thwm in the respective directories with just a few clicks.
2) Converting images to data points: A code to convert the images to arrays and store them as pickle files.
3) Model Training: Build a simple convolutional neural network and train it on the data.
4) Designing the game: Use open cv for real time prediciton. we get a random move from the computer and the code recognizes our move. The winner is then based on the below algorithm.
